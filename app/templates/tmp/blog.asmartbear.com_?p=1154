You have to trust me&#8221; without sounding like a prick?</p></blockquote><p>I like a doctor analogy.</p><p>The doctor says you have a rare liver disease and you&#8217;ll need to treat it with a dangerous cocktail of drugs. How do you evaluate whether the doctor is right?</p><p>For almost all of us, the answer is: You can&#8217;t.</p><p>You can&#8217;t ask for details, because you&#8217;ll get a torrent of nomenclature that&#8217;s greek to you (much of which really is Greek, or Latin), body parts you never knew existed, drug names you can&#8217;t spell with interactions you&#8217;ve never heard of, and references to studies you can&#8217;t read.</p><p>Even if she explained these details, you can&#8217;t evaluate the context&nbsp;&#8212; which of those things is dangerous, or unusual? Which are easy or hard to treat? Which are easy to deal with in isolation but complex when they interact? What other things isn&#8217;t she saying because in her expert mental process she takes them for granted?</p><p>You might try to evaluate the doctor herself, rather than her diagnosis, but here too your lack of expertise leaves you helpless. You can&#8217;t grill the doctor on medical knowledge&nbsp;&#8212; even incompetent ones know far more than you and can easily overwhelm you with terminology and information. You can&#8217;t ask for references because of course she&#8217;ll hand you good ones.</p><p>In the end there&#8217;s nothing you can do, because this is a field that takes years to master, in both education and real-world experience, the complexities and context of which cannot be satisfactorily transmitted to even an intelligent layman.</p><p>You&#8217;re going to have to trust your doctor.</p><p>That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like talking to the architect of a software product containing a million lines of code. It&#8217;s not that the customer is &#8220;stupid,&#8221; nor that given enough time, training, and explanation, couldn&#8217;t eventually understand it all fully. But sometimes the customer just has to trust the vendor.</p><p>One way around this with doctors is to get a second opinion. You still can&#8217;t make the call, but at least you can get another expert on the case. Of course if the experts differ, you&#8217;re still stuck. Maybe a third opinion?  And even then they might choose the wrong course.</p><p>The problem with software is that other experts don&#8217;t know the intricacies of the software product in question.  They don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s in <em>those</em> millions of lines of code, or the trade-offs made by <em>that</em> product&#8217;s creators. The vendor might indeed be incompetent, or shrouding themselves in terminology to avoid helping the customer, and a second opinion isn&#8217;t an option. That&#8217;s unfortunate.</p><p>That&#8217;s why this comes down to <em>trusting</em> your software vendor, just like your trust your doctor. If you don&#8217;t, no one can help you, because you don&#8217;t believe what they say and yet cannot evaluate what they say. If that&#8217;s case, sounds like you need a new vendor.</p><p>So, as the vendor yourself, I would say (and in fact <em>have said</em>) all of the above. Put yourself out there. Make this a moment where you build trust.</p><p>All <em>good</em> business is built on that&nbsp;&#8212; trust, which is then not abused.</p><p><b><i>Add your advice to the <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/non-technical-communication.html#respond">discussion section</a>!</i></b></p><hr /><p></p><p class="float:right; margin-left:3em;">   </p>
