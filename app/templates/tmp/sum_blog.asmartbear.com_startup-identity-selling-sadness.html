The first emotion I felt after selling Smart Bear was a profound sadness. Not depression — not hopeless or rudderless — but a pure sadness, when your lungs sink into your belly, the punch-in-the-stomach of discovering your dog was hit by a car or that your dad is terminally ill.
"What the fuck?" I thought, "Why am I feeling this? I'm supposed to be feel... happy? I guess? Something other than this."
