But that means they&#8217;re no good for large, complex, distributed, multi-user projects. Older PM tools understood that use-case, but they&#8217;re clunky install-only implementations where online collaboration, mobile and even the Mac is a bolt-on afterthought.  My PM tool is best for large, complex projects with modern technology requirements.</li><li>PM tools were built in the installed- or web-based-eras.
