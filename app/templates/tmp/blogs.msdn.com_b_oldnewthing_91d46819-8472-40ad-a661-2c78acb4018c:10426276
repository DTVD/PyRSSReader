I dreamed that I was playing doubles tennis.
My partner was Boris Becker.
Our opponents were the Queen of England and a policeman on a horse.
The horse served his horseshoe,
which I returned poorly.
As the horseshoe bounced across the ground,
it made huge divots.
The game was called due to poor ground conditions.

The Queen played a game with the crowd by pretending to sit down
(allowing everybody to sit),
then faking them out and standing (making everybody stand up again).
