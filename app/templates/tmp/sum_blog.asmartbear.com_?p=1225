What do you do once your startup is off the ground and it's time to make a "real" investment in advertising?  Should you work on optimizing AdWords since they're working, or optimizing banner ads since they're not working?  Should you cut off the affiliate program since it's a waste of time, or redouble your efforts in affiliate management? Should you optimize these existing channels or try to find a new, more productive channel?
