I dreamed that
Swedish had separate third-person-plural pronouns based on gender.
They were formed from
<i lang="sv">han</i>
and
<i lang="sv">hon</i>
by adding a common suffix,
but the pattern broke down for
<i lang="sv">det</i>,
and I got stuck trying to finish a sentence without knowing the correct word.

I was able to escape from this embarrassing situation by using
a technique available only in dreams:
I woke up.
