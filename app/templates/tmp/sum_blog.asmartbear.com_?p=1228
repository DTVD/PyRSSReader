Isn't entrepreneurship about having an amazing idea and building a living around it?
...yes, except every advisor and blogger admonishes "your idea sucks," you prima donna pompous asshole, so your job is to use an "idea" as a foil to find out what is actually an amazing idea and then go follow that path, whatever that might be. The only thing we're sure of is that you're wrong and you need get that fixed.
...OK, except how is that even "your company" anymore?  Those are someone's else's ideas, not your idea.
