<p>   </p><p>Seems like every third startup nowadays is using the &#8220;Freemium&#8221; business model: The lowest service tier is free, and the business is designed to get those users hooked and then upgrade to a paid plan.</p><p><a href="http://www.andertoons.com/psychology/cartoon/6178/by-way-im-having-special-this-month-have-one-breakthrough-get-another-free/"><img alt="free breakthrough" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1191" height="360" src="http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cartoon6178.png" width="480" /></a></p><p>It can work wonderfully of course, but usually it crushes and <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2011/your-job-ensure-this-never-happens-to-you/">destroys companies</a>, not only because it costs more than anticipated but because the founders didn&#8217;t realize the business model itself caused them to make incorrect decisions.</p><h3><strong>Foibles of Freemium</strong></h3><p>Let&#8217;s dispose of some misconceptions about what Freemium actually does for you and how much it costs.</p><p><strong>Freemium is not customer development</strong></p><p>Just imagine how much you&#8217;ll learn once you have 1,000 real, <em>active</em> users of the system: Everything from behavioral statistics (which features are actually used?) to democratic product development (voting on which features customers would like to see next?).</p><p>Trouble is, those freemium users are not like those who will actually give you money. Frequently the features that paying customers want don&#8217;t show up on the freebie&#8217;s radar.</p><p>Think about it: Almost none of the freeloaders will convert to even the smallest tier. If you suddenly started charging only $1/mo for your service, most wouldn&#8217;t come aboard. Why is that? Because the need, the interest-level, the value to the end user isn&#8217;t pressing enough for even a pittance. But those who will pay $10/mo or $100/mo do have needs, and it&#8217;s not just a matter of scale (i.e. because they require more resources), it&#8217;s a difference in kind.</p><p>Your problem is that freemium users outnumber your paying customers 100-to-1, so in feedback forums they drown out the voices of those who actually matter.</p><p><strong>Freemium conversion rates makes marketing expensive</strong></p><p>A really <em>good </em>conversion rate for free-to-paid is 4%, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriabarret/2012/11/13/dropbox-hits-100-million-users-says-drew-houston/">like Dropbox</a>. Awesome for them, but normal rates are more like 1%, and that&#8217;s if users are reasonably active.</p><p>I surveyed a dozen small startups who <em>don&#8217;t</em> use freemium, and on average they see a 1% conversion rate from web traffic to a (real, not &#8220;free&#8221;) purchase. <i>[UPDATE: Andy Brice has <a href="http://successfulsoftware.net/2009/04/23/the-truth-about-conversion-ratios-for-software/" target="_blank">much more data</a> which supports this simple assumption]</i> Even assuming you can get a higher website-to-signup rate for a freemium offering (you&#8217;d better, right?), you only get paid on on a few percent of those, which means your total conversion rate of web visitors to actual money is 20-100x worse than other startups.</p><p>Which means it costs 20-100x as much on marketing campaigns to achieve the equivalent revenue.</p><p>This essentially takes paid-advertising and almost all other forms of marketing off the table for driving growth in a freemium business, unless you&#8217;re willing to take big losses to get things rolling.</p><p>It also means you essentially <em>have</em> to build a viral product, because you can&#8217;t afford advertising. Getting true viral behavior is very hard&nbsp;&#8212; again most companies who attempt this will fail&nbsp;&#8212; and even so you need to seed it at the beginning, so you still have the marketing expense problem.</p><p>The few companies who were clear winners here also raised millions in funding, in part to get over this hump.</p><p><strong>Freemium tech support is expensive</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s easy to say &#8220;We&#8217;ll just direct everyone to forums,&#8221; but when people email tech support they want a response.</p><p>It&#8217;s easy to say &#8220;We won&#8217;t provide tech support for the free tier&nbsp;&#8212; they&#8217;ll understand since it&#8217;s free,&#8221; but if you really do ignore them they&#8217;ll be less successful with your tool, which means far less chance of them converting, and less change they&#8217;ll evangelize to friends and coworkers.</p><p>It&#8217;s easy to say &#8220;We&#8217;ll provide a lesser grade of support for the free tier,&#8221; but that means every tech support email and chat session and phone call has to be coupled to an account, so you&#8217;re wasting time figuring out what level of support this person &#8220;deserves.&#8221;</p><p>Are you prepared for people who say, &#8220;If you help me through this, then if it works I&#8217;ll pay.&#8221; Are you hard enough to shut the door in their face, even knowing that in fact they probably still won&#8217;t pay?</p><p>If you care about good support&nbsp;&#8212; one of the few true competitive advantages a small startup can have&nbsp;&#8212; can you really segment who gets treated well and who gets the cold shoulder? Should you really turn your back on the <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/tech-support-is-sales.html">benefits great tech support brings</a>? Is that conducive to converting free accounts to paid accounts? Is it helping your company&#8217;s reputation?</p><h3><strong>Advantages of Freemium</strong></h3><p>Obviously freemium also has important benefits which cannot be denied:</p><ul><li><strong>Easy to upsell.</strong> They&#8217;re already using your tool, so whether it&#8217;s by special offer, changing the pay scale, or the user just outgrows the confines of their service tier, there&#8217;s many ways a person can start giving you money. That&#8217;s something few other business models can boast.</li><li><strong>Stats for selling.</strong> It&#8217;s awesome homepage marketing to be able to say &#8220;Join 1,000 other happy users.&#8221; It&#8217;s social proof, just like the RSS counter in the corner of the blog implicitly saying &#8220;if 40,000 others think it&#8217;s worth their time to read this every week, maybe it&#8217;s worth yours too.&#8221; It&#8217;s also useful when bagging bigger customers because it proves your system can scale, both in technology and in training new users with minimum effort.</li><li><strong>Easy to start.</strong> Even a &#8220;30-day free trial&#8221; or &#8220;money-back guarantee&#8221; is a much bigger barrier than &#8220;free.&#8221; Getting a web visitor to stop perusing and start using the product is a critical step in any customer acquisition, and you&#8217;ve just diminished the barrier as much as possible.</li><li><strong>Not using the competition.</strong> Well, they <em>might</em> still be, but at least you have a horse in the race. One more user for you is one fewer user for them.</li></ul><p>So in the face of the positives and negatives, how do you decide whether it&#8217;s right for you and, if it is, how do you think about it so that you&#8217;re reaping the benefits while mitigating the costs?</p><h3><strong>Charge Freemium to the marketing department</strong></h3><p>A pattern emerges from those &#8220;advantages&#8221; bullets: <strong>It&#8217;s all marketing.</strong> It&#8217;s lead-gen, reducing barriers to conversion, and competitive advantage.</p><p>Retool your expectations of Freemium: It&#8217;s a <em>marketing cost. </em>It&#8217;s more expensive than you give it credit for, but it could very well be the best marketing strategy available.</p><p>So how do you decide whether those costs are worth the benefits? My technique is to &#8220;charge the marketing department&#8221; exactly like AdWords or any other lead-gen campaign: measuring the total cost of acquiring new paying customers.</p><p>The reasoning is: You have a theory that by spending the money to support these freeloaders, you&#8217;re in fact building an efficient path to real, paying customers. That goal&nbsp;&#8212; revenue&nbsp;&#8212; could possibly be attained other ways: AdWords, blogging, or <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/startup-marketing-ideas.html">any other marketing technique</a>. So just like any marketing campaign, the marketing department should pay, measure the results, and compare the ROI against other methods.</p><p>(And make sure the cost is much less than the total revenue&nbsp;&#8212; the equation that most startups fail to achieve, exactly because they don&#8217;t honestly consider the total cost to acquire.)</p><p><strong>How do you decide how much to charge the marketing department?</strong> Suppose you really were charging those customers, but also that you&#8217;re only looking to recoup costs and not make a profit. Amortize those costs&nbsp;&#8212; servers and tech support&nbsp;&#8212; and come up with a correct cost-replacement price for that tier.</p><p>That&#8217;s what those users <em>should</em> be paying (minus profit), so that&#8217;s the amount the marketing department needs to &#8220;reimburse&#8221; the rest of the company.</p><p>Obviously you shouldn&#8217;t get carried away with the bookkeeping. But you have no excuse to not be measuring that per-user cost so that you&#8217;re running this Freemium program with full knowledge of the cost and comparing it to other forms of marketing.</p><h3><strong>Further Reading</strong></h3><p>More great articles on the subject:</p><ul><li><a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/37737/Secrets-Of-Freemium-Pricing-Make-The-Cheapskates-Pay.aspx">Andy Singleton</a> on how to &#8220;make those cheapskates pay.&#8221;</li><li><a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2009/01/19/how-to-create-a-profitable-freemium-startup-spreadsheet-model-included/">Andrew Chen</a> on the precise financial model of freemium (spreadsheet included).</li><li><a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/01/three-freemium-strategies.html">Eric Ries</a> on three strategies for &#8220;free&#8221; that still lead to making money.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p></p><p class="float:right; margin-left:3em;">   </p>
