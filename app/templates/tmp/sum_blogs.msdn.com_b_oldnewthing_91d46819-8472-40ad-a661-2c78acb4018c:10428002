I dreamed that I finished biking home and decided not to take
the stairs. Instead I took my bicycle into the elevator
to go to my dream-land 31st-floor high-rise condo.
(As if.)

For "security reasons" there were no buttons in the
elevator. You had to open a secret panel and flip a
circuit-breaker switch corresponding to the floor you want
to go to. If you open the wrong panel, you are instead
faced with a stack of hot-swappable SATA drives with labels
like "Windows 95" and "Windows 95 OSR&nbsp;2".
And yes, I know that SATA didn't exist in 1995.
