I accidentally went and did <em>all</em> that at Smart Bear, and only had millions of dollars of revenue to show for it. Largely from The Enterprise.</p><p>Does that mean &#8220;They&#8221; are wrong? Nope. &#8220;They&#8221; are in fact describing the way most <em>successful</em> companies sell to The Enterprise. Nothing wrong with &#8220;tried and true.&#8221;</p><p>Unless tried and true doesn&#8217;t happen to jibe with you.

Unless you <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/creativity-over-optimization.html">prefer excitement</a> over <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/roi-selling.html">ROIs</a>. Unless you&#8217;re happy to <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/competing-big-companies.html">compete with big companies</a> instead of becoming one.</p><p>I wasn&#8217;t trying to be &#8220;<a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/not-disruptive.html">disruptive</a>&#8221; or &#8220;innovative&#8221; or a &#8220;maverick.&#8221; I just <em>couldn&#8217;t do it</em>. Maybe you&#8217;re like that, about something.</p><p>You&#8217;ll have a harder road if you ignore &#8220;Them&#8221; because it leads to <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/startups-emotionally-draining.html">gut-wrenching awkwardness</a>. But at least you&#8217;ll be different. Sometimes just being different is enough, if it&#8217;s for good reason.</p><p>Who knows. Do it your own way, but you&#8217;d better have your eyes open so you can address the special challenges you&#8217;re bringing on yourself. Once you buck &#8220;Their&#8221; wisdom, you can&#8217;t rely on &#8220;Them&#8221; when you get yourself into an unusual pickle.
